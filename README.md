# FISH 576 & 577: Applied Stock Assessment I & II

This is a repository for the 2025 applied stock assessment course at the University of Washington. 

## IMPORTANT DEADLINES:

- May 21, 2025: Internal review deadline
- June 11, 2025: Groundfish subcommittee of the SSC review in Rohnert Park, CA and online

## How this repository works:

This repository contains lectures, example code, and background reading materials for both courses. Materials will be added as the course progresses.

Please ensure you have a github handle and are subscribed to announcements under [discussions](https://github.com/okenk/Assessment_Class/discussions/categories/announcements). Github announcements will be our primary way of communicating with you as it allows students who drop the course to opt out, and students who start the course late to catch up on old communications. **Either check the github announcements regularly or ensure you are getting email alerts for new announcements.**

Feel free to also use discussions to communicate with your fellow classmates and the instructors!

## Overview:

Applied Stock Assessment I and II are a two-quarter applied stock assessment series offered in collaboration with stock assessment scientists in the Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring Division at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center. The first course provides a review of population dynamic modeling basics and stock assessment data types, and then focuses on the details of processing fishery and survey data for use in stock assessment and running Stock Synthesis (SS3) stock assessment models. The second course focuses on developing, running, evaluating and documenting the base and sensitivity Stock Synthesis (SS3) models required for a stock assessment update submitted to the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) for use in management.

## Course format:

This is a hybrid course, with in-person and virtual participation available. Winter quarter, we will meet at UW in FSH 105. There is also a group meeting in person at Oregon State University. For online login information, contact the instructors.

## Scheduled course times (subject to change based on participant schedules): 

Thursdays 9:00am-9:50am and Fridays 9:00am-9:50am

## FISH 576: Applied Stock Assessment I

Students will work as a team to:

1.  Review assessment documents, STAR reports, and identify new literature

2.  Work up data for the update assessments

3.  Update data as each data source is finalized

4.  Begin work on producing an update stock assessment that involves updating and adding recent data from all data sources used in the previously reviewed stock assessment adopted for management.

### Learning goals:

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

1.  Evaluate and process length and age composition data and fishery-independent indices.

2.  Evaluate and process survey index data.

3.  Run existing Stock Synthesis models and replace or extend data in input files for catch, indices, composition, discard, and environmental data.

4.  Understand basic modeling assumptions and when they might be violated.

## FISH 577: Applied Stock Assessment II

Students will work as a team to:

1.  Run the update stock assessment model and sensitivities.

2.  Build decision tables to provide catch advice to managers.

3.  Report results through a document and presentations.

Students will focus on running the stock assessment model under different configurations, ensuring model convergence, interpreting and comparing results and underlying assumptions, and documenting the stock assessment update in a document and presentations before the PFMC’s Scientific and Statistical Committee’s Groundfish Subcommittee. The PFMC’s Scientific and Statistical Committee and its Groundfish Subcommittee will review the update stock assessment.

1.  Read, understand and revise Stock Synthesis input files.

2.  Modify Stock Synthesis input files to reflect sensitivity runs, and run them.

3.  Run likelihood profiles in Stock Synthesis

4.  Produce forecasts using Stock Synthesis.

5.  Run R4SS software to produce plots from Stock Synthesis output.

6.  Write an updated stock assessment report.

7.  Present stock assessment results to the PFMC.
