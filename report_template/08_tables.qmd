## Tables 
 
```{r} 
#| label: 'set-rda-dir-tbls'
#| echo: false 
#| warning: false 
#| eval: true 
#| include: false
library(flextable)

# You can save tables to read in as csv or rda files.
# stockplotr generally uses rda files.
# I (Kiva) prefer csv files because they are text files that are easier to track and preview with version control.

# There are many ways to incorporate tables into quarto documents.
# One is using the flextable package via R chunks.
